## Graph Machine Learning
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are gaining attention in data science and machine learning but still remain poorly understood outside expert circles. 
There is another thing called Graph Machine learning (GML) but not to confuse with GNNs :GML’s primary purposes is to **compress** large sparse graph 
data structures to enable feasible prediction and inference

### Graphs
َHas 3 main componeents : Nodes, Relationships, Properties
